Overview\r\n1.1 Background\r\nIn the country island of Kronos, the increasing noxious effects on health and farming have been related to the uncontrolled activity of GAStech, a natural gas operator, supported by corrupt government officials. On January 20th, 2014, a corporate meeting is held to celebrate the new-found fortune because of the initial public offering of the company. However, a series of rare events occur that lead to the disappearance of several employees. The Protectors of Kronos (POK), a social movement organization that has been fighting against water contamination and government corruption, is suspected in the disappearance.\r\nAs analysts, we were assigned with several tasks in order to identify risks and how they could have been mitigated more effectively.\r\n1.2 Literature review\r\n1.3 Objective\r\nUsing data and visual analytics to evaluate the changing levels of risk to the public and recommend actions for first responder:\r\nDistinguish meaningful event reports from typical chatter from junk or spam.\r\nEvaluate the level of the risk to the public evolves over the course of the evening. Consider the potential consequences of the situation and the number of people who could be affected. Determine the appropriate location for first responders.\r\nThe differences between dealing with this challenge in 2014 and dealing with it now.\r\n1.4 Question 1\r\n1.5 Question 2\r\n1.6 Question 3\r\n1.7 Question 4\r\n2. Building the visualization\r\n2.1 Setting up the environment/packages\r\nFirst, we run this fist line of code to clear the environment and remove existing R objects(if any).\r\n\r\n\r\nrm(list = ls())\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis code chunk checks if required packages are installed. If they are not installed, the next line of code will install them. The following line is then use to import the library into the current working environment.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('readr','tidytext','data.table','lubridate','ggplot2',\r\n             'caret','dplyr','tidyr','scales','quanteda','textdata',\r\n             'stringr','stringi','reshape2','RColorBrewer','wordcloud',\r\n             'forcats','igraph','ggraph','widyr','clock','knitr','tidyverse',\r\n             'DT','hms')\r\nfor(p in packages){\r\n  if(!require(p,character.only = TRUE)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p,character.only = TRUE)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
