<hr />
<h3 id="background">1.1 Background</h3>
<p>In the country island of Kronos, the increasing noxious effects on health and farming have been related to the uncontrolled activity of GAStech, a natural gas operator, supported by corrupt government officials. On January 20th, 2014, a corporate meeting is held to celebrate the new-found fortune because of the initial public offering of the company. However, a series of rare events occur that lead to the disappearance of several employees. The Protectors of Kronos (POK), a social movement organization that has been fighting against water contamination and government corruption, is suspected in the disappearance.</p>
<p>As analysts, we were assigned with several tasks in order to identify risks and how they could have been mitigated more effectively.</p>

<li><p>Evaluate the level of the risk to the public evolves over the course of the evening. Consider the potential consequences of the situation and the number of people who could be affected. Determine the appropriate location for first responders.</p></li>

<h4 id="data-processing">2.3.1 Data processing</h4>
<p>In question 1, extract the required data from the <font color = red><em>df</em></font> to make a new data frame. After reading all the data carefully, the terminology of <font color = red><em>mbdata</em></font> and <font color = red><em>ccdata</em></font> is very different, so separate the two files. Since ccdata is a police or fire department record, this dataset is labeled as a meaningful dataset.</p>
